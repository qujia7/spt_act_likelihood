DR6 Lensing Likelihood Data
===========================

Version: v1.2
Date: 2023-12-22

This data should be copied to the cloned git repository
for the likelihood software: https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/act_dr6_lenslike

The `data` directory should be inside the directory that has __init__.py in
the cloned repositry. Copy it there. Only then should you proceed with
the pip install.


A typical Cobaya block should have:

likelihood:
		act_dr6_lenslike.ACTDR6LensLike:
		        lens_only: False
				stop_at_error: True
				lmax: 4000
				variant: act_baseline

Set lens_only to True if not including primary CMB information.

Other variants include:
- act_extended (extended multipole range up to L=1250)
- actplanck_baseline
- actplanck_extended

The latter two combine ACT and Planck lensing.

Changelog
---------

Changes w.r.t. v1.1:
* Bug fix for likelihood correction derivatives. Results in negligible differences to parameter constraints, only for combinations with 2-point CMB power spectra.

Changes in v1.1 w.r.t. v1.0:
* Bug fix for ACT+Planck covariance matrices
